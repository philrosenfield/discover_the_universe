# Shape of the Earth
**Date** 8 Mar 2017
**Lesson** 1 of 8

## Learning Target
*What knowledge or skill will students be able to demonstrate at the end of class?*
Students will be able to demonstrate the Earth may look flat in their everyday experience, it is in fact round. The will also be guided to reframe their understanding of gravity in order to fit the round earth concept.

## How does this activity connect to the Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks?
* [5-ESS1-2 (page 44)](http://www.doe.mass.edu/frameworks/scitech/2016-04.pdf)

## Supplies/Resources Needed:
* 8-10 ft weather balloon
* Means to inflate weather balloon
* Paper and writing utensils (colored pencils, markers)
* Steel globe
* Magnets

## Special Needs, Learning Styles, and Considerations:
*Are there any behavioral or academic needs in the classroom that should be taken into account?  How will you adapt your activity to make sure it runs smoothly, all needs are met, and everyone is included?*

**Behaviors, Modeling, and Agreements:**
*Are there any new routines that should be practiced? Are there safety concerns that should be addressed, or behavior agreements that should be made for this activity?*

Students should use caution while weather balloon is inflated and deflated.

#	 Introduction
As student arrive they will be asked what shape the Earth is and how they learned the answer.

When class starts there will be a short introduction about what these classes are going to be like, and that they may be different than other classes they have had before. In this class the most important thing is not the answer, but the path we take to the answer.

Next, students will draw their concept of the Earth's shape and explain it with each other.
* How did they learn what the shape was?
* Can they tell what the shape of the Earth is by standing outside?
* Where would you want to stand (or take a picture) to see what the Earth's shape is?

#	 Activity
* Let's make a model! (instructor inflates balloon)
* What shape is the balloon? (round, a ball)
* (Students walk up to the balloon and place their cheeks or nose against it) Does the balloon still look round? Can you tell that it is a ball shape if you could only see this part?
* Instructor takes out a globe: The earth is round, but it is so large, it's very hard to tell from where we stand, it is even hard to tell if we are looking out the window of an airplane.

### Epilogue
* (Students return to their seats) If the Earth is round, and people are living on the surface, why don't people in Australia fall off?
* Placing magnets on the steel globe, instructor discusses how gravity pulls everything to the center of the Earth, so no one falls off, even though the Earth is round.

# Reflection
Students will take the last few minutes of the lesson to draw another picture of the shape of the Earth based on what we learned. We will talk about the differences, making sure to point out that even if students had the "right" answer on the first try, in our class it is more important we learn to explain to others how we arrive at our answers, than it is to be "right."

Reflection prompts:
* Draw another picture of the shape of the Earth based on what we spoke about today
* How would you convince someone who says the earth is shaped like a Pizza that is shaped like a ball?

# How did it go?

*After you’ve implemented your class the first time, spend a few minutes reflecting about how it went.  Write your answers here.*

*Think about things like:*
*	What did you change?  Why?
*	What happened that you didn’t expect?  Was that good or bad?
*	What were the students interested in that wasn’t part of your plan?
*	Were they more/less engaged than you expected?
*	What would you do differently next time?


# The Second Try

*	What did you change in your plan the second time?  Why?
*	How did your reflection above, and/or feedback, change your plan?
*	How was this session different than the first time you tried your activity?
*	What was improved? What didn’t go well?
